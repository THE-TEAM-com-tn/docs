## Auth - Logins, Register ..etc (10)

The Authentication API provides secure endpoints for managing user access on the Learning Management System (LMS).

**It supports:**

- Register (Sign up) / Create A User As Admin (uses the register endpoint).

- Login (with/without 2FA).

- Authentication with CAPTCHA (Cloudflare Turnstile).

- Recovery code-based 2FA fallback.

- Multilingual login support (English, Arabic, French).

- Lgout & Logout from all devices.

All endpoints are prefixed with <Badge>/auth.</Badge>

You can test these APIs interactively through Mintlify's OpenAPI block.

<Info>
 All endpoints require **Bearer Token** authentication via **laravel sanctum**.
