# Verify Email
**GET** <Badge>/auth/email/verify_email/`{user_id}`</Badge>

Verifies a newly registered user’s email address using the verification link sent via email.
This endpoint finalizes the email verification process, marking the user’s email as verified in the database and optionally redirecting to the frontend.

**Overview**
When a new user registers, they receive a verification email containing a link like:

```
https://api.the-team.tn/v1/auth/email/verify_email/{user_id}
```
Clicking this link calls this endpoint, confirming ownership of the provided email address.

Once verified, the user can proceed to log in.
If the email was already verified, the endpoint returns a message indicating that status.

**Headers**
| Key                                   | Type      | Required  | Description
| --------------------------------------- | --------- | --------- | ------------------------------------  |
|  <Badge>Accept</Badge>              |  string  | ✅ Yes    | Should be <Badge>application/json</Badge> |
|  <Badge>Authorization</Badge>              |  string   | ❌ No    | Not required (public endpoint).  |

**Response :**
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="200">
    ✅ 200 OK – Email Verified Successfully
    
    If the verification is successful, the endpoint marks the user’s email as verified and returns a success message (or redirects to your frontend confirmation page).
    ```
{
  "message": "Email verified successfully."
}
    ```
    The endpoint may also return an HTML response with a 5-second redirect:
    ```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html

[Verification successful — redirecting to your dashboard...]
    ```    
    Redirect URL: $`{FRONTEND_URL}`

    ⚠️ 200 OK – Email Already Verified

    If the email was already verified earlier:
```
{
  "message": "Email already verified."
}
    ```    
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="404">
    ⚠️ 404 Not Found – User Not Found
    
If no user exists for the provided ID:
  ```
{
  "message": "User not found."
}
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="500">
    ❌ 500 Internal Server Error – General Failure

    If something unexpected occurs during verification:
 ```
{
  "message": "Failed to verify email. Please try again later."
}
 ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


**Notes**

- Once verified, the user can log in normally using <Badge>/auth/login</Badge>.

- Redirects automatically after 5 seconds to the frontend defined in <Badge>FRONTEND_URL</Badge>.

# Resend Verification Email
**POST**<Badge>/auth/email/resend_verification_email</Badge>

Resends a verification email to the specified user if their account has not yet been verified.
This endpoint includes rate limiting to prevent abuse (default: 6 requests per minute).

**Middleware**
This route uses the following middleware:

- <Badge>throttle:6,1</Badge> → limits requests to **6 per minute** per IP/user.

- Optional: <Badge>api</Badge>, <Badge>guest</Badge> depending on your route group.

⚠️ **No authentication required** — this endpoint can be used before login.
