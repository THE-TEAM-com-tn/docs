Each user is assigned a role that defines what actions they can perform.

- Full access to all modules
- Can override permissions if needed

---

## Admin

- Manages trainings, exams, and content
- Controls landing page configuration

---

## Instructor
- Creates and manages trainings
- Uploads lessons and quizzes

- Has a public instructor profile
- Revenue percentage configuration (if enabled)

---

## Student
- Enrolls in trainings

---

## Permission System

- Permissions are attached to roles
- Backend policies enforce access control
- Frontend UI adapts based on role permissions
- Unauthorized actions are blocked at API level

## Notes
- A user’s role can be changed unless restricted by business rules (e.g. instructor with active trainings).
- Archived or deleted users cannot access the platform.
