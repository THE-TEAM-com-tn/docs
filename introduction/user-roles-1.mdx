# User Roles

The LMS platform is built around a **role-based access control (RBAC)** system.  
Each user is assigned a role that determines **what they can access, manage, and modify** across the platform.

Roles are enforced at both:
- **Backend level** (Laravel policies & permissions)
- **Frontend level** (UI visibility & access control)

---

## Super Admin

The **Super Admin** has full control over the entire platform.

### Responsibilities
- Manage all companies on the platform
- Configure global platform settings
- Manage roles and permissions
- Access all users, trainings, exams, and orders
- Override company-level restrictions when required

### Notes
- Super Admin users are excluded from standard user listings.
- This role is reserved for platform owners or core system administrators.

## Admin (Company Administrator)

The **Admin** manages the platform **within a specific company**.

### Responsibilities
- Manage company users (create, update, archive, restore, delete)
- Assign and change user roles
- Manage instructors and students
- Configure company branding and landing page
- Manage trainings, exams, and categories
- View and manage orders and invoices

### Access Scope
- Limited to their own company data
- Cannot access other companies’ data

## Instructor

The **Instructor** role is responsible for creating and managing educational content.

### Responsibilities
- Create and manage trainings
- Upload lessons, videos, and materials
- Create quizzes and exams
- View student enrollments and performance
- Maintain a public instructor profile

### Public Profile
Instructors can have a **public profile** including:
- Skills and biography
- Contact and social links
- Profile visibility settings

### Important Rules
- If an instructor already has trainings assigned, their role **cannot be changed**
- Instructor profiles may be hidden automatically when role changes

---

## Student

The **Student** is the primary consumer of the learning content.

### Responsibilities
- Browse available trainings and exams
- Purchase trainings or exams
- Access enrolled content
- Take quizzes and exams
- Download invoices for paid orders

### Access Scope
- Students only access content they have purchased
- Exam access can be revoked at order level

## Content Manager

The **Content Manager** focuses on **content organization and presentation**, without full administrative privileges.

### Responsibilities
- Manage trainings and exams content
- Organize featured trainings and exams
- Configure landing page sections (featured categories, partner companies)
- Control display order and visibility

### Limitations
- Cannot manage users or roles
- Cannot access billing or system-level settings

---

## Role & Permission System

### How Permissions Work
- Each role has a defined set of permissions
- Permissions are enforced using Laravel policies
- API endpoints validate permissions before executing actions

### Frontend Behavior
- UI components are displayed based on role permissions
- Unauthorized actions are hidden or disabled
- Backend always acts as the final authority

---

## User Lifecycle States

A user can be in one of the following states:
- **Active** – full access based on role
- **Blocked** – access temporarily disabled
- **Archived** – user removed from active usage but kept for history
- **Deleted** – permanently removed from the system
