# Platform Overview

The LMS platform is built as a **modern web-based learning system** that allows organizations to manage trainings, exams, instructors, students, and content through a centralized interface.

The system follows a **client–server architecture**, separating frontend presentation from backend business logic.

---

## High-Level Architecture

The platform consists of three main layers:

### 1. Frontend (Web Application)
- Built with **Flutter Web**
- Uses **CanvasKit renderer** for high performance
- Handles UI, user interactions, and state management

### 2. Backend (API Layer)
- Built with **Laravel**
- Exposes RESTful APIs
- Manages authentication, authorization, business rules, and data persistence

### 3. Database & Storage
- Relational database (MySQL)
- File storage for images, videos, PDFs, and assets

---

## Core Functional Areas

- **User & Role Management**
- **Trainings & Courses**
- **Exams & Quizzes**
- **Orders & Payments**
- **Landing Page Customization**
- **Company & Platform Configuration**

---

## Data Flow (Simplified)

1. User interacts with the frontend (Flutter Web)
2. Frontend calls backend APIs via HTTP (Dio + Retrofit)
3. Backend processes the request and returns JSON responses
4. Frontend updates UI state using Providers

---

## Design Philosophy

- Modular and scalable
- API-first approach
- Clear separation of concerns
- Multi-company and multi-role ready
